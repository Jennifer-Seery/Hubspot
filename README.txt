Note: Sorry guys! Work was super busy over the weekend and I didnt get a chance to finish it. I only really could spare a day of work due to how busy I was. I tried to add an example of each different area present just to display what I know. For example, I used gulp, ejb, npm, scss, javascript, working with json etc.

If I had more time, I would fix the appearance of the GUI more CSS add in the images. Improve filtering and make it more efficent. Implement filtering of years and add in the testimonials. 


The GUI can be seen by running the 'gulp' command. All needed files get added into the 'build' directory.
